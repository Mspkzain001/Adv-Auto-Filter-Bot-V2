## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

To start, configure the `credential.env` file with your Telegram API credentials. Update it with the following format:

```env
API_ID=your_api_id
API_HASH=your_api_hash
PHONE_NUMBER=your_phone_number
SESSION=your_session_string
```

### 2. Push Changes to GitHub

We’ve included a `GitUpdate.sh` script to streamline the process of pushing local changes to your GitHub repository. After making changes to the project, simply run:

```bash
bash GitUpdate.sh
```

This will automatically commit and push your changes to the remote repository.

## 📅 Coming Soon

We’re actively developing new features to make the bot more powerful. Here’s what’s in the pipeline:

- **Advanced Task Customization**: Choose which tasks to automate based on your preferences.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Track your earnings and view completed tasks in a user-friendly dashboard.
- **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Smarter handling of bot errors and retries for smoother automation.

## 💡 Example Use Cases
